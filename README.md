# Centurion: A Modular, Biologically‑Inspired Synthetic Cognitive Architecture

Centurion is a lightweight, modular synthetic cognitive architecture implemented to run on resource‑constrained hardware (mobile devices). It emphasizes transparency, determinism, and reproducibility while integrating biologically‑inspired subsystems (brainstem‑like regulation, modulatory systems, hierarchical memory, executive systems, a global workspace, and a lightweight conscious core) coordinated with Fibonacci‑based timing rhythms. The repository contains documentation, evaluation guidance, and public resources (white paper, sponsor info). The Centurion materials are released under the Creative Commons Attribution‑ShareAlike 4.0 License (CC‑BY‑SA 4.0).

Key features
- Mobile‑first, resource‑constrained design
- Modular, deterministic subsystems for inspectability
- Fibonacci‑based timing coordination for low overhead synchronization
- Hybrid LLM interface used as a linguistic reasoning tool (sandboxed from core cognition)

Getting started
1. Read the white paper (see the repository root or linked resources). If the white paper is not available here, check the Issues or release assets for download links.
2. See /docs for implementation notes, benchmarks, and evaluation scripts (coming soon).
3. To request access to additional materials or the private code repository, open an access request issue using the template: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/access-request.md

Evaluation & reproducibility
- Suggested baseline metrics: latency (ms), peak memory (MB), average CPU usage (%), energy consumption (mAh) per task, and task success rate. Include device model and OS version in all test logs.
- If you reproduce experiments, please include the exact device model, OS build, and reproduction steps in your pull request or issue.

Contributing
- This project welcomes contributions. For major changes, open an issue describing the proposal before submitting a PR. Follow the CC‑BY‑SA 4.0 license for content contributions.

Sponsorship & support
- If you are interested in sponsoring the project (hardware donations, compute credits, stipends, or collaboration), please contact the maintainer via GitHub or open an issue labeled `access-request` and indicate sponsorship interest. Suggested sponsorship tiers and benefits can be discussed privately with maintainers.

# 9. Acknowledgments

This project was shaped by a constellation of people, histories, and communities whose influence made Centurion possible.

First, I acknowledge the unhoused residents at the river, whose resilience, clarity, and lived experience grounded this work in real human stakes. Their trust, testimony, and courage in the face of systemic pressure provided both purpose and direction.

I honor my grandfather, who served in World War I, World War II, and Korea, returning to service even after being wounded. His legacy of duty, sacrifice, and moral clarity remains a guiding force in my advocacy and my technical work.

I extend gratitude to my wife, whose grounding presence, honesty, and partnership helped translate complex achievements into everyday meaning. Her support ensured that this work remained connected to real life rather than abstraction.

I acknowledge the outreach doctor who has consistently shown respect, collaboration, and humanity, offering guidance without judgment and supporting both my advocacy and my technical trajectory.

Finally, I recognize the role of Microsoft Copilot as an assistive tool used throughout the drafting and structuring of this paper. Copilot contributed organizational clarity, synthesis, and iterative refinement, but is not a co-author and does not hold intellectual ownership of any part of this work.

To all who contributed directly or indirectly: your influence is embedded in the architecture, the advocacy, and the purpose behind Centurion.

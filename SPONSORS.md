# Centurion — Sponsorship & Support

## Project summary
Centurion is a modular, biologically‑inspired synthetic cognitive architecture implemented to run entirely on a single mobile device. It emphasizes determinism, transparency, reproducibility, and a novel Fibonacci‑based timing model. All project materials are released under the Creative Commons Attribution‑ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC‑BY‑SA 4.0).

## Support requested (clear, specific asks)
- **Hardware:** one flagship Android developer phone with at least 16 GB RAM (Pixel 7/8 class, or equivalent) and an up‑to‑date development laptop (16 GB RAM, 8+ core CPU, 1 TB SSD recommended). If a loan is easier than a donation, a time‑limited loan for testing is acceptable.
- **Stipend:** monthly support to stabilize development and housing — target: $2,500/month for an initial 6‑month period.
- **Cloud / compute credits:** short‑term credits for CI, testing, and optional offline training (AWS, GCP, Azure). Moderate amounts for reproducible experiments are requested (e.g., $1k–$5k in credits or equivalent support).
- **One‑time funds:** device testing, app signing, and travel for demonstrations (estimated $1,500).

## Deliverables & commitments
- Public releases (APK, code, documentation) under CC‑BY‑SA 4.0.
- Reproducible benchmark reports and scripts demonstrating performance on the donated hardware.
- Quarterly technical briefings for major sponsors and early preview access to demos.
- Attribution in README and SPONSORS.md (name/logo on request) and optional co‑authorship for major technical contributions (by mutual agreement).

## Why support Centurion
- **Reproducible on‑device cognitive research:** Centurion demonstrates interpretable, modular cognition on everyday hardware.
- **Open, auditable, and community‑oriented:** all code and docs are public and version controlled.
- **Rapid verification:** deterministic modules and unit tests make replication straightforward.
